     * One possible implementation could be that instead of having to count from 0 to the number put in by the user every time 
     * primeCache does not contain the required information, we could update it with the numbers from the previous maximum
     * to the current maximum (which is the number put in by the user). We could change the array to an arrayList so that we could
     * reuse the same collection and then just update it every time. E.g. letÂ´s say we have already tested all values up until 10. 
     * The next time, the user asks whether 15 is a prime or not. Instead of testing all values again up until 15, we could just 
     * test all values from 11 to 15 (number - primeCache.length (primeCache.size() in this case because we make it into an 
     * arrayList))
