/**
 * A hash table-based implementation of the Set interface.
 *
 * This is a hashtable where each index in the table contains a linked list - or rather a pointer to the first node in a linked list
 *
 * BIBLE FOR FUTURE HEADACHES WITH HASHTABLES
 *
 * In a hash table the index number is somehow related to the data at that index
 * e.g. we want to populate an array
 * We want to add the name Anna, we will get the ASCII code of all the letters and add them together
 * then we divide this by the number of elements in the array
 * we take the remainder of that calculation, which will become the index for the place where Anna will be
 * Thus the index is decided : index = (sum of ASCII) mod size of array
 * But what if we could put more information at that index
 * e.g. that Anna is 27 years old, that she is a teacher etc.
 *
 * A hashing algorithm is something that translates the information taken from
 * a piece of data that is to be added to a hashset and turns it into an
 * appropriate index number
 * It applies the algorithm to so called keys and tranforms it into an index also called an "adress"
 * For numeric keys we often use the method of taking the key mod size of availabe adresses/index numbers
 * For alphanumeric keys we take the asci code mod size of available adresses
 * However there are many other hash algorithms to choose from some better than others, depending on the nature of your data
 *
 * Collisions happen when we calculate an index for a new piece of data to add, where the index is already occupied
 * For this piece of data we look for the nearest place forward in the array where we can put the piece of data
 * This particular addressing technique is called linear probing, where we find the next available slot if a place is occupied
 * However we will find a problem with looking up data when there has been collisions
 * The more items in a hashtable, the larger the likelihood for collisions
 * One way to deal with this is to create a larger hashtable than needed, that is - more space than the amount of data you have
 * so that e.g. 70% of the hashtable is every occupied, meaning every time you add data, it expands
 * The ratio between the number of occupied index places and the size of the array is called the load factor
 * E.g. if we use an arraylist, which is dynamic, the resizing can happen automatically when the load factor reaches a certain threshold
 *
 * Another way to deal with collisions is known as chaining
 * Instead of placing Anna at index X we put a pointer at index X which points to Anna and this becomes the pointer to the first node in a linked list
 * When e.g. Bill is calculated to be at index X aswell, Bill is just added as another node to the linked list which also contains Anna.
 * Anna is thus pointing to bill
